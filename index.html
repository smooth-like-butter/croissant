    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
      of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
      dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough
      is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
      then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The
      process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. Kipferls have long been a
      staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries.

      The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French
      bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made,
      frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could
      be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
      Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,
      and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries and
      patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
